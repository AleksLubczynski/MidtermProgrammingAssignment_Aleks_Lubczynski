Project Description: 
This project is my Midterm SwiftUI App for CIS 137. This app displays a list of images from a dataset, which is loaded from a JSON file as the base.

Project Demonstration:
- Loading and coding JSON data in a Swift app
- Builds user interfaces with SwiftUI coding
- Uses lists, navigation links, and container views efficiently
- Displays images, text, and detailed information in a scrollable list

Project Features:
- Display of content from Data.json
- Interactive navigation system using 'NavigationView' and 'NavigationLink'
- Layouts represented by 'VStack' and 'HStack'
- Includes a detailed view of each of the images with a description text and a zoom-in feature

Project Instructions:
First, launch the app, where it will display a scrollable list with six different images of beautiful places to visit from the JSON file.
Second, browse through the list and scroll up or down to observe the different places.
Third, you can tap on one of the images, which will take you to a detailed description of that place and what it's known for.
Finally, you can press the top left corner arrow to be directed back to the main page and the scrollable list.

Here is the video that shows how the app works:
